abstract = {The problem addressed in this paper is to predict a user's numeric rating in a product review from the text of the review. Unigram and n-gram representations of text are common choices in opinion mining. However, unigrams cannot capture important expressions like "could have been better", which are essential for prediction models of ratings. N-grams of words, on the other hand, capture such phrases, but typically occur too sparsely in the training set and thus fail to yield robust predictors. This paper overcomes the limitations of these two models, by introducing a novel kind of bag-of-opinions representation, where an opinion, within a review, consists of three components: a root word, a set of modifier words from the same sentence, and one or more negation words. Each opinion is assigned a numeric score which is learned, by ridge regression, from a large, domain-independent corpus of reviews. For the actual test case of a domain-dependent review, the review's rating is predicted by aggregating the scores of all opinions in the review and combining it with a domain-dependent unigram model. The paper presents a constrained ridge regression algorithm for learning opinion scores. Experiments show that the bag-of-opinions method outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques for review rating prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {Helpful online reviews could be utilized to create sustainable marketing strategies in the restaurant industry, which contributes to national sustainable economic development. This study, the main aspects (including food/taste, experience, location, and value) from 294,034 reviews on Yelp.com were extracted empirically using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and positive and negative sentiment were assigned to each extracted aspect. Positive sentiments were associated with food/taste, while negative sentiments were associated with value. This study further proves a robust classification algorithm based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Fuzzy Domain Ontology (FDO) algorithm outperforms other traditional classification algorithms such as Na&iuml;ve Bayes (MB) and SVM ontology in predicting the helpfulness of online reviews. This study enriches the literature on managerial aspects of sustainability by analyzing a large amount of plain text data that customers generated. The results of this study could be used as sustainable marketing strategy for review website developers to design sophisticated, intelligence review systems by enabling customers to sort and filter helpful reviews based on their preferences. The extracted aspects and their assigned sentiment could also help restaurateurs better understand how to meet diverse customers&rsquo; needs and maintain sustainable competitive advantages.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of Web 2.0, travelers have started sharing their travel experiences on websites. The expanding amount of online hotel reviews results in the problem of information overload. Therefore, the effective identification of helpful reviews has become an important research issue. In this study, online hotel reviews were collected from TripAdvisor.com, and the helpfulness of these reviews was comprehensively investigated from the aspects of review quality, review sentiment, and reviewer characteristics. Review helpfulness prediction models were also developed by using classification techniques. The results indicate that reviewer characteristics are good predictors of review helpfulness, whereas review quality and review sentiment are poor predictors of review helpfulness.}
