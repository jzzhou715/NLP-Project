Predicting Yelp review popularity and classifying type of votes
---------------------------------------------------------------
 
This research project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict Yelp review popularity
with review data by aggregating reaction votes of "useful," "funny," and "cool" to
indicate popularity. In addition, a Naive Bayes multi-classifier model is also used to
classify which reaction upvote is the best indicator of review popularity.

Usage: `python NLP.py --df yelp.csv`
